                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>At <strong>Chalte Chalte</strong>, we believe in travel that connects you to the essence of India. Our philosophy is simple: discover, immerse, and experience the culture and beauty of India in an authentic and enriching way.</p>
                <p><strong>Chalte Chalte</strong> custom tours are for people who have a genuine desire to see and experience India. The tours are for those who are open-minded, adventurous, and not afraid to welcome new experiences, cultures, ideas, and ways of life. They are for travellers who love to go off-the-beaten path and have authentic cultural experiences.</p>

                    <p>We care about the principles that drive responsible travel and sustainable tourism. We always opt for local providers such as local guides, recommend locally owned guest houses and home stays, and promote more women in tourism.</p>
                    
                    <p> Our mission is to help people travel safely and well in India.</p>
                    
                        <p>If there is one place on the face of earth where all the dreams of living people have found a home, it is India.</p>
                    
                    <p>— Surbhi Sah</p>
                    <p> <strong>Chalte Chalte</strong> custom tours are for people who are flexible and willing to adjust – people who understand that things do not always go as planned in India. There is a certain amount of trust involved in travel in India: trust that the “right thing” will happen, even if it’s not the “planned thing.” </p>
                    
                        <p>India is a very special place – however, it is not always an easy or a comfortable place. To enjoy the experience of travel in India, you have to adjust your expectations. Things do NOT go as smoothly or efficiently as they do may do in your own home country, for example. The more flexible you can be, the better. “Go with the flow” is the best attitude you can have. </p>
                    
                            <p>It’s also important to leave pre-conceived ideas about India at home. India is an extremely diverse country – and for almost every statement you can make about it, the opposite is also true. “All life is here,” as the saying goes. </p>

                <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
            <p>We design travel experiences that go beyond typical tourist attractions. Our aim is to offer you a deeper connection to the land, its people, and its history, while promoting responsible and sustainable travel practices.</p>
            <p>India for Beginners custom tours are for travellers visiting India for the first time … and also for anyone willing to travel in India with a “beginner’s mind” – an open attitude that allows you to see everything as if for the first time. </p>

            <p>The most important thing about travel in India is to understand that things do not always go as planned. And this is especially true in the wake of the pandemic. The travel industry was hit hard, and many businesses closed, others are staggering along with insufficient staff, etc. Local flight timings change without notice, trains get delayed, and other unexpected travel delays happen quite often.</p>

            <p>It’s important to be able to go with the flow – in fact, you could say this is one of the lessons of travel in India. It’s also important to try and be as understanding, compassionate, and open as possible (while remaining alert, of course). </p>

            <p>There is a belief in India that everything happens the way it is meant to. So we ask our guests to be open to this idea, and to go with the flow, and accept what India offers you.</p>

            <p><strong>Chalte Chalte</strong> tours are not for everyone. But for those who want to experience the magic of India, we encourage you to take the leap … </p>
